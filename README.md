## Project Status: In Active Development

This repository is currently in development. The multi-agent systems framework and educational content are being built from the ground up with a focus on production-grade architecture and enterprise reliability.

> *Watch this space, we're building something different for the agent development community.*

---

## Vision: Enterprise-Grade Multi-Agent Framework

Most "AI agent" implementations are shallow wrappers around LLM APIs. This project will provide **production-ready architecture** with async/await patterns, comprehensive monitoring, and enterprise-grade reliability.

### What We're Building

| Component | Description | Status |
| --------- | ----------- | ------ |
| **BaseAgent** | Enterprise-grade agent with async perception-action cycle | In Development |
| **ReactiveAgent** | Priority-based behavior rules with statistics tracking | In Development |
| **Environment** | Scalable state management and agent registration | In Development |
| **Examples** | Production-ready demonstrations (Smart Devices, etc.) | In Development |
| **Documentation** | Comprehensive guides and API documentation | In Development |

### Framework vs. Tutorial Code

| Aspect | Tutorial Code | Agent Academy Framework (Planned) |
| ------ | ------------- | --------------------------------- |
| **Architecture** | Single function calls | Full perception-action cycle |
| **Concurrency** | Basic threading | Async/await throughout |
| **Error Handling** | Try/catch | Timeout handling, retry logic |
| **Monitoring** | Print statements | Performance metrics, observability |
| **Production Ready** | No | **Enterprise-grade** |

---

## Development Roadmap

### **Phase 1: Core Framework** (In Progress)
- [ ] **BaseAgent Architecture**: Async perception-action cycle with timeout handling
- [ ] **ReactiveAgent Implementation**: Behavior rules with priority system
- [ ] **Environment System**: State management and agent registration
- [ ] **Performance Monitoring**: Built-in metrics and observability
- [ ] **Type Safety**: Complete type hints for enterprise development

### **Phase 2: Examples & Validation** (Planned)
- [ ] **Smart Device(s) Demo**: Working example with behavior rules
- [ ] **Multi-Agent Scenarios**: Agent coordination and communication
- [ ] **Performance Benchmarks**: Load testing and optimization
- [ ] **Test Suite**: Comprehensive coverage and validation
- [ ] **Documentation**: API docs and usage guides

### **Phase 3: Advanced Features** (Future)
- [ ] **Distributed Communication**: SPADE framework integration
- [ ] **Modern Protocols**: Support for cutting-edge agent communication
- [ ] **Enterprise Deployment**: Production deployment patterns
- [ ] **Monitoring & Observability**: Advanced performance tracking

---

### Planned Production Features

- **Async/Await Architecture**: Full concurrency support for scalable deployment
- **Performance Monitoring**: Built-in metrics collection and analysis
- **Error Recovery**: Timeout handling, retry logic, graceful degradation
- **Type Safety**: Complete type hints for enterprise development
- **Observability**: Structured logging with performance tracking

---

## Getting Started (When Ready)

The framework will support modern Python development practices:

```bash
# Planned installation process
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
git clone https://github.com/Cre4T3Tiv3/agent-academy-labs
cd agent-academy-labs
uv sync --all-extras
```

## Design Philosophy: Production Over Prototypes

### What We Will Build
- **Hand-crafted agent architectures** with proper lifecycle management
- **Enterprise-grade async patterns** for scalable deployment
- **Comprehensive monitoring** with performance tracking
- **Type-safe implementations** for maintainable code

### What We Won't Build
- No shallow LLM wrappers or prompt chains
- No demo-level code that breaks in production
- No framework dependencies that hide architectural complexity
- No magic that obscures how agents actually work

### Our Approach
- **Technical rigor**: Every component designed for production use
- **Performance focus**: Benchmarked and optimized for real workloads
- **Educational value**: Code that teaches proper agent architecture
- **Community driven**: Open source with comprehensive documentation

> **Question for the Developer Community**: What if agent frameworks started with production-grade architecture instead of tutorial-level wrappers?
